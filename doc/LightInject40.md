## LightInject 4.0 ##
LightInject 4.0 marks a new era for LightInject with support for a broader range of platforms including iOS, Android and the new CoreCLR.

With C# and .Net now being available on practically any platform and any device it becomes more and more important to provide cross-platform libraries.

Whether you are developing mobile applications or working on high performance server side applications,  LightInject provides the same simple API across all environments.

A lot of effort has been made into making sure that LightInject performs optimally regardless of the target platform and 
is cross-compiled into platform specific binaries.

In addition to a totally revamped build system (scriptcs), the unit  tests has also been migrated from MsTest to xUnit 2.

LightInject now supports the following frameworks.

* Net 4.0
* Net 4.5
* Net 4.6
* DNX451
* DNXCORE50
* Portable class library (Profile 111)
